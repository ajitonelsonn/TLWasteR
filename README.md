## üö© The Problem: Waste Management in Timor-Leste

Timor-Leste, particularly Dili Municipality, faces significant waste management challenges:

- **303 tons of waste generated daily** with limited collection coverage
- **112 tons of uncollected waste daily** often ending up in waterways and oceans
- **Inefficient monitoring systems** making it difficult to target problem areas
- **Limited citizen engagement** in the waste management process
- **Flooding issues** during heavy rainfall due to waste clogging drainage systems - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1AoKoEOr4

- **Marine ecosystem damage** from plastic waste entering oceans

## üß† AI and Technical Capabilities

### Multimodal AI Analysis with ASI-1 Mini

Our system leverages ASI-1 Mini's advanced capabilities to:

1. **Verify Waste in Images**: First determines if an image actually contains waste
2. **Classify Waste Types**: Identifies specific categories (plastic, organic, etc.)
3. **Assess Severity**: Rates issues on a scale of 1-10 based on multiple factors
4. **Generate Detailed Descriptions**: Creates comprehensive scene descriptions for authorities

Example analysis results:

```json
{
  "waste_type": "Plastic",
  "severity_score": 8,
  "priority_level": "high",
  "environmental_impact": "Water contamination risk due to proximity to drainage",
  "estimated_volume": "2.5 cubic meters",
  "safety_concerns": "Sharp objects present",
  "short_description": "Plastic waste accumulation near drainage",
  "full_description": "The image shows a significant accumulation of plastic waste blocking a drainage channel. Various plastic containers, bags, and packaging materials are scattered along the drainage path. This poses an immediate flooding risk during rainfall and water contamination hazard."
}
```

### Hotspot Detection Algorithm

Our spatial clustering algorithm identifies waste hotspots using:

1. **Proximity Analysis**: Groups reports within 500m radius
2. **Frequency Weighting**: Prioritizes areas with multiple reports over time
3. **Severity Enhancement**: Factors in AI-assessed severity scores
4. **Temporal Patterns**: Identifies recurring issues vs. one-time problems

## üìö Technical Implementation

### AI Agent Implementation with Fetch.ai SDK

```python
# Simplified example of Analysis Agent initialization
from uagents_core.crypto import Identity
from fetchai.registration import register_with_agentverse

analysis_identity = Identity.from_seed(os.getenv("ANALYSIS_AGENT_SEED"), 0)

# Register with Agentverse
register_with_agentverse(
    identity=analysis_identity,
    url=webhook_url,
    agentverse_token=os.getenv("AGENTVERSE_API_KEY"),
    agent_title="TL Waste Analysis Agent",
    readme=agent_description
)
```

### ASI-1 Mini Integration for Image Analysis

```python
# Simplified example of waste image analysis
def analyze_image_with_asi1(image_url):
    # Download and process image
    response = requests.get(image_url)
    image_data = base64.b64encode(response.content).decode('utf-8')

    # Prepare multimodal message with image for waste verification
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Is this image showing waste or garbage? Analyze in detail."
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_data}"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    # Process with ASI-1 Mini API
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.asi1.ai/v1/chat/completions",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {ASI1_API_KEY}"},
        json={"model": "asi1-mini", "messages": messages}
    )

    # Parse and structure the analysis results
    return structured_analysis_results
```

### Hotspot Detection Algorithm

```python
# Simplified spatial clustering for hotspot detection
def check_for_hotspot(latitude, longitude, report_id):
    # Find reports within 500 meters
    nearby_reports = execute_query("""
        SELECT COUNT(*) as nearby_count
        FROM reports
        WHERE (
            6371 * acos(
                cos(radians(%s)) * cos(radians(latitude)) *
                cos(radians(longitude) - radians(%s)) +
                sin(radians(%s)) * sin(radians(latitude))
            )
        ) < 0.5  -- Within 500 meters
        AND report_id != %s
    """, (latitude, longitude, latitude, report_id))

    # If there are 3+ reports (including current one), create/update hotspot
    if nearby_reports['nearby_count'] >= 2:
        # Create or update hotspot logic
        create_or_update_hotspot(latitude, longitude)
